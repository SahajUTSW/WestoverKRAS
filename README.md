KRAS Mutation Analysis in Colorectal Cancer (CRC) and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Overview

This repository contains Python scripts designed to analyze KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The analysis focuses on identifying significant genetic pathways in cell lines with specific KRAS mutations compared to wild-type (WT) cell lines. The results include gene enrichment analysis (GEA) data, filtered cell lines, and visual representations of enriched pathways in the form of pie charts.

Repository Contents

CRC Analysis Script (crc_analysis.py): Python script to perform KRAS mutation analysis on colorectal cancer cell lines.

NSCLC Analysis Script (nsclc_analysis.py): Python script to perform KRAS mutation analysis on non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.

Data Folder (data/): Contains the necessary CSV files for running the analysis.

Output Folder (crc_output/ and nsclc_output/): Contains the output files generated by the scripts, including filtered cell lines, GEA results, and pie charts.

Required Files (To successfully run the analysis scripts for CRC and NSCLC, you must download the following data files):

Model.CSV (Contains information about various cancer cell lines, including their primary disease classification.)

OmicsSomaticMutations.CSV (Contains mutation data for the cell lines, including gene mutations and their impacts.)

Must be placed in the data/ directory.
